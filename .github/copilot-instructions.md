# Intrusion Detection System

This is a Python-based intrusion detection system using computer vision to analyze camera feeds. It uses OpenCV for video processing and analysis, along with machine learning techniques for motion detection and object recognition.

The system should focus on:

1. Real-time video processing
2. Motion detection algorithms
3. Object recognition (particularly human figures)
4. Alert systems when intrusions are detected
5. Logging capabilities for security events
